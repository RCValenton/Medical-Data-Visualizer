## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes patient data from a medical examination dataset using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

The project includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing outliers and normalizing values
- **Categorical Plot**: Visualizing the relationship between categorical features and cardiovascular disease
- **Heat Map**: Displaying the correlation matrix for all numerical features

## 📁 Dataset Used

The data comes from a CSV file (`medical_examination.csv`) and includes the following fields:
- Age, height, weight, gender
- Blood pressure (ap_hi, ap_lo)
- Cholesterol & glucose levels
- Smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity
- Presence of cardiovascular disease

- Grouped by whether or not the individual has cardiovascular disease

### ✅ Heat Map
- Displays correlation between variables like age, weight, blood pressure, etc.
- Cleaned to remove outliers and ensure meaningful correlations
